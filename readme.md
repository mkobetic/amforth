This project has moved to https://github.com/amforth32

This is a fork of https://sourceforge.net/p/amforth/code/2462/.

The purpose is to advance the 32-bit ARM and RISC-V variants of AmForth.

For more information see the [documentation](https://amforth32.github.io/amforth32/) and the READMEs in the respective directories:

* [core/](core) - the shared 32-bit AmForth core
* [arm/](arm) - the ARM architecture core (Cortex M3/4)
* [rv/](rv) - the RISC-V architecture core
* rv/mcu/..., arm/mcu/... - AmForth for different boards and targets

Pre-built binaries for various targets are available as Github releases.

AmForth is an interactive Forth for various controllers
It does not need additional hard or software. It works 
completely on the controller (no cross-compiler). AmForth 
uses the indirect threading forth implementation technique.
