/*
WORD: star-slash
STACK: ( n1 n2 n3 -- n4 )
CATEG: MATH
SHORT: Multiply n1 by n2 producing the intermediate double-cell result d. Divide d by n3 giving the single-cell quotient n4.

An ambiguous condition exists if n3 is zero or if the quotient n4 lies outside the range of a signed number.
If d and n3 differ in sign, the implementation-defined result returned will be the same as that returned by either the phrase >R M* R> FM/MOD SWAP DROP or the phrase >R M* R> SM/REM SWAP DROP.
